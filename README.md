## Self Driving Cars Longitudinal and Lateral Control Design 

In this project, I implemented a  controller in Python and use it to drive a car autonomously around a track in Carla Simulator.

### Project notes:

The waypoints include positions as well as the speed the vehicle should attain. As a result, the waypoints
become the reference signal for our controller and navigating to all the waypoints effectively completes the full track.


Since the controller reference contains both position and speed, we need to implement both Longitudinal and Lateral Control.


The output of the controller will be the vehicle throttle, brake and steering angle commands.

The throttle and brake come from the Longitudinal speed control and the steering comes from our Lateral Control.


If you want to make your own controller design,  I highly recommend that you should consider the following points:

If you open the simulator directory and navigate to the Course1FinalProject folder, you will see a file named controller2d.py

These controller functions are as the following.



You can adjust and re-create these functions according to your own custom controller design.
